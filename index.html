    <h2>The 4th Generation</h2>
    <p>
      When people talk about the 4th Generation of K-pop girl groups, almost all of them include these three groups: Aespa, STAYC, itzy, and Fromis_9. These groups have shown their tremendous performance both on vocals and dance. Each of them also has a loyal fandom, so that some of them even look like a new wave of cultural evolution. Since the prior generation of famous K-pop girl groups such as Twice, Red Velvet, GFriend, and BlackPink are called '3rd Generation', we could call this new generation of groups '4th Generation'. This web page will show and introduce you to each of these 4th Generation of K-pop girl groups.
