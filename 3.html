      itzy's biggest strength is <strong>choreography</strong>. Their tracks are also make a great fit in their choreo. Minimizing the place for vocals, their tracks make listeners and fans to focus on their choreo and other visual stuff. When you listen their tracks from debut to present days, you can see the bass and beat is going harder and deeper. This specialty makes them more special since their ancestor, Twice had made their focus on vocals and hooking attribute more than hard performance.</p>
