They made a debut on <u>Feb 12, 2019</u> with debut track <u>'Dalla Dalla'</u> in <strong>JYP entertainment</strong>. Though they made a rivarly with IZ*ONE: who've been mainly considered as the last runner of 3rd Generation, since they are now competing with other groups in 4th Generation, most of people consider them as 3.5 Generation or 4th Generation. Proving their fame and rivarly with IZ*ONE, both groups won almost same number of ROTY in 2019.</p>

      itzy's biggest strength is <strong>choreography</strong>. Their tracks are also make a great fit in their choreo. Minimizing the place for vocals, their tracks make listeners and fans to focus on their choreo and other visual stuff. When you listen their tracks from debut to present days, you can see the bass and beat is going harder and deeper. This specialty makes them more special since their ancestor, Twice had made their focus on vocals and hooking attribute more than hard performance.</p>
