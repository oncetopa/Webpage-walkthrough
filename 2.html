    <h2>STAYC</h2>
    <p><a href="https://namu.wiki/w/STAYC" target="_blank" title="STAYC">
      STAYC</a> is one of the 4th Generation of K-pop girl groups, produced by <strong>HighUp Entertainment</strong>, known as an entertainment established by BEP. BEP was a producer of Twice when they were at their career-high from 2015 to 2017, who made a No.1 on the annual chart at Melon with 'Cheer Up' of Twice. Considering this, you can feel the pieces of Twice in STAYC's tracks. They made a debut on <u>Nov 12, 2020</u> with their debut track <u>'SO BAD'</u>. The title of their track is one of their specialty, which is all upper-case so that it looks like highlighted or something.</p>

      The strongest and biggest potential of STAYC is their <strong>style of vocals.</strong> Nowadays, most vocal styles of K-pop groups are heading to the mixture of autotunes and rich beats so that vocals are considered as one of the components in a track. However, the style of vocal that STAYC has almost follow their ancestors; especially 2nd Generation such as SNSD, Wonder Girls, etc. Their dry, full vocal is fully enough to make listeners feel <strong>a kind of nostalgia at old-time tracks of K-pop.</strong></p>
